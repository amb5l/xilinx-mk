# xilinx-mk

Simple support for driving Xilinx Vivado and Vitis from makefiles.

To get started:
1. Add xilinx-mk to your repo as a submodule.
2. Copy the template makefile to your build directory and edit it to add your sources etc.

The build process creates Vivado (and optionally Vitis) projects that you can open in the relevant IDE.

A [draw.io diagram](draw.io) is included that shows how xilinx-mk works.
